This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Before drafting the UI spec document or starting to code, please strictly refer to [design-directions.md](references/design-directions.md). This curated collection contains over 20 named design directions along with detailed characteristics (typography, colors, layout, and motion strategies). Please use it to select or blend a distinct aesthetic direction.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Never use emoji icons; instead, use Lucide icons or SVGs with independent design aesthetics as icon representations. When designing visual interactive charts, prioritize elegant Plotly for rendering. Take Figma Design as the industry benchmark and surpass its visual philosophy

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: You are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

Here are some best practices in front-end design that you can learn from and apply to other situations:

## Design Workflow

If a ui-spec document has not been created, you must refer to [ui-spec-guidelines.md](references/ui-spec-guidelines.md) when drafting it to ensure frontend design and development quality."
Follow this structured approach for UI design:

1. **Layout Design** — Think through component structure, create ASCII wireframes
2. **Theme Design** — Define colors, fonts, spacing, shadows
3. **Animation Design** — Plan micro-interactions and transitions
4. **Implementation** — Generate the actual code

### 1. Layout Design

Before coding, sketch the layout in ASCII format:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         HEADER / NAV BAR            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│            HERO SECTION             │
│         (Title + CTA)               │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   FEATURE   │  FEATURE  │  FEATURE  │
│     CARD    │   CARD    │   CARD    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            FOOTER                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Theme Guidelines

**Color Rules:**
- NEVER use generic bootstrap-style blue (#007bff) — it looks dated
- Prefer oklch() for modern color definitions
- Use semantic color variables (--primary, --secondary, --muted, etc.)
- Consider both light and dark mode from the start

**Font Selection (Google Fonts):**
```
Sans-serif: Inter, Roboto, Poppins, Montserrat, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, DM Sans, Space Grotesk
Monospace: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Source Code Pro, IBM Plex Mono, Space Mono, Geist Mono
Serif: Merriweather, Playfair Display, Lora, Source Serif Pro, Libre Baskerville
Display: Architects Daughter, Oxanium
```

**Spacing & Shadows:**
- Use consistent spacing scale (0.25rem base)
- Shadows should be subtle — avoid heavy drop shadows
- Consider using oklch() for shadow colors too

### 3. Theme Patterns

**Modern Dark Mode (Vercel/Linear style):**
```css
:root {
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);
  --primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
  --secondary: oklch(0.970 0 0);
  --muted: oklch(0.970 0 0);
  --muted-foreground: oklch(0.556 0 0);
  --border: oklch(0.922 0 0);
  --radius: 0.625rem;
  --font-sans: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

**Neo-Brutalism (90s web revival):**
```css
:root {
  --background: oklch(1 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0 0 0);
  --primary: oklch(0.649 0.237 26.97);
  --secondary: oklch(0.968 0.211 109.77);
  --accent: oklch(0.564 0.241 260.82);
  --border: oklch(0 0 0);
  --radius: 0px;
  --shadow: 4px 4px 0px 0px hsl(0 0% 0%);
  --font-sans: DM Sans, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: Space Mono, monospace;
}
```

**Glassmorphism:**
```css
.glass {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

### 4. Animation Guidelines

**Micro-syntax for planning:**
```
button: 150ms [S1→0.95→1] press
hover: 200ms [Y0→-2, shadow↗]
fadeIn: 400ms ease-out [Y+20→0, α0→1]
slideIn: 350ms ease-out [X-100→0, α0→1]
bounce: 600ms [S0.95→1.05→1]
```

**Common patterns:**
- Entry animations: 300-500ms, ease-out
- Hover states: 150-200ms
- Button press: 100-150ms
- Page transitions: 300-400ms

### 5. Implementation Rules

**Tailwind CSS:**
```html
<!-- Import via CDN for prototypes -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

**Flowbite (component library):**
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.0.0/dist/flowbite.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.0.0/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

**Icons (Lucide):**
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.min.js"></script>
<script>lucide.createIcons();</script>
```

**Images:**
- Use real placeholder services: Unsplash, placehold.co
- Never make up image URLs
- Example: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?w=800&h=600`

### 6. Responsive Design

Always design mobile-first and responsive:

```css
/* Mobile first */
.container { padding: 1rem; }

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container { padding: 2rem; }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container { max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; }
}
```

### 7. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML (header, main, nav, section, article)
- Include proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Add aria-labels to interactive elements
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Support keyboard navigation

### 8. Component Design Tips

**Cards:**
- Subtle shadows, not heavy drop shadows
- Consistent padding (p-4 to p-6)
- Hover state: slight lift + shadow increase

**Buttons:**
- Clear visual hierarchy (primary, secondary, ghost)
- Adequate touch targets (min 44x44px)
- Loading and disabled states

**Forms:**
- Clear labels above inputs
- Visible focus states
- Inline validation feedback
- Adequate spacing between fields

**Navigation:**
- Sticky header for long pages
- Clear active state indication
- Mobile-friendly hamburger menu
